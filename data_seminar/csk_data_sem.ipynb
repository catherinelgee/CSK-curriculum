    "[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The file that we are on now is a jupyter notebook, and it's used fairly extensively in the data science industry. It consists of a series of cells that you can run in real time.\n",

Prediction involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew. Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Clubs** - Data Science Society at Berkeley, Opportunity Through Data, Big Data at Berkeley, Data Bears, Launchpad...you can find out more about different data science-focused student organizations on [Callink](https://callink.berkeley.edu/organizations) or Facebook!<br>\n",
    "- **Course staff** - You can help teach the data science classes you've completed! [Data 8](http://data8.org/), the intro to data science class, is always in need of course staff because it's such a massive course. Lab assisting/tutoring/TAing is an awesome way to keep engaging with the material and get some really valuable experience teaching and helping students out. Plus, depending on what role you're hired for on course staff, you can get paid!<br>\n",
    "- **URAP** - Cal runs the [Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program](https://urap.berkeley.edu/) every semester, with both new and continuing projects. It's a great opportunity to get hands-on experience working with faculty and/or grad students and learn how data science can be applied to a ton of different academic fields!<br>\n",
    "- **Division of Data Science** - [The Division](https://data.berkeley.edu/) offers all sorts of helpful resources for students interested in data science, like peer advising where you can talk to other undergraduates for advice, conceptual help, and planning out your data science courses.<br>\n",
    "- **Data Scholars** - [Data Scholars](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/data-scholars) is a program run by the Division that's dedicated to providing mentorship, prep, interview tips, resources, and so much more for minorities (like women!) in data science to introduce and prepare them to intern or work in industry.<br>\n",
    "- **D-Lab** - [The D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) runs technical workshops almost every weekday about a wide variety of data science + computer science concepts and applications, from programming language introduction crash courses to natural language processing to neural networks. Check out their [calendar](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) to see what kinds of workshops they're offering soon!<br>\n",

    "Here are just a few of the applications of data science with other fields:\n",
    "- **Autonomous cars** are using data science applications to collect data on traffic flow, driver behavior, and more to improve self-driving technology as much as possible. \n",
    "- Data science can also be used in **healthcare** to detect and diagnose diseases earlier, to curate individual recommendations based on wearable technology sensors, and to improve the accuracy of diagnoses. \n",
    "- Incorporating data science skills into **public safety** can help catch criminals through facial recognition analysis, increase the accuracy of forensics, as well as limit racial bias and discrimination. \n",
    "- Data science also has lots of intersection with **environmental sustainability**, tracking climate change across the world to mitigate its negative impact. \n",

    "Data science as a field has so many opportunities and intersects with nearly every other field. Having the analysis and technical skills will allow you to conduct research and create recommendations to solve almost any problem. \n"
