    "[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The file that we are on now is a jupyter notebook, and it's used fairly extensively in the data science industry. It consists of a series of cells that you can run in real time.\n",

    "## 0.1 Cells\n",
    "This notebook is made out of a series of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button (▶|) in the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. \n",

    "> Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data sets through exploration, prediction, and inference. Exploration involves identifying patterns in information. Prediction involves using information we know to make informed guesses about values we wish we knew. Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations?\n",
