    "[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The file that we are on now is a jupyter notebook, and it's used fairly extensively in the data science industry. It consists of a series of cells that you can run in real time.\n",
